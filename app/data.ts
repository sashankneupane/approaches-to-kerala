These connections were first established through the spice trade, which brought Arab traders to Kerala and facilitated centuries of exchange in goods, culture, and traditions. I have chosen to explore this through a collection of videos taken in Kerala, with each clip from Kerala followed by a corresponding shot from the UAE. I used the background sounds from both locations along with interviews to give context to the visuals."
